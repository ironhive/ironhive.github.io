                    <blockquote>We have functional, we need usable.</blockquote>

                    <p>When I joined the Harvest team, we had just reached minimum viable product. The pieces were all there and things were working. The experience left a lot to be desired, and that's where I came in.</p>
                    <p>
                        My role on the project covered everything from user research to interaction design to prototyping to implementation of UI features.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>Are we building the right features?</blockquote>

                    <p>
                        While we had our product team working hard on the business side of things, I was there to help align the business with what users were telling us they needed or were struggling with. To help align our UX strategy with our business strategy, I would lead exercises like affinity mapping.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>So, how does it work?</blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Once expectations were aligned, it was time to start designing features. Lots of sketching and explaining and getting feedback. And often pseudo-code right on the page as design neared the need for a testable prototype.

                    <blockquote>Documentation</blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Before production on any feature began, documentation would be provided. Sometimes it was a wireframe, a comp, an interactive prototype (codepen/jsfiddle) or something in between that detailed every possible state.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Typically more complex interactions or highly-visual features would be on my plate for implementation. Time to trade hats and code for production.
